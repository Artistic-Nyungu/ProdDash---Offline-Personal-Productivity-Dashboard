So I asked ChatGPT to give me a cool project idea that is VERY unrestricted, this is what it came up with. I will be trying to implement the idea. Of course I won't follow everything to the dot, especially when it comes to the tools and technologies.

### **Project Plan: Customizable Personal Productivity Dashboard**

#### **Overview**
The project will be developed over a span of 12 weeks, divided into four major phases. Each phase will include specific milestones, and the modular architecture will allow for easy integration of future features.

---

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Core Feature Implementation (Weeks 1-3)**

#### **Goals**:
- Set up the development environment.
- Implement core features: To-Do List, Notes, Calendar, Habit Tracker.
- Establish a modular architecture.
- Ensure basic offline functionality.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **Development Environment**:
   - Install and set up `Node.js`, `Electron.js`, `React`, `Redux/MobX`, and `LocalForage`.
   - Create initial project structure with React and Electron integration.
   - Create the Electron main process (`main.js`) and configure `package.json` for running the app.

2. **Core Feature Implementation**:
   - **To-Do List Module**:
     - Create UI components for task creation, viewing, and editing.
     - Use Redux to manage task state (add, edit, delete).
     - Store tasks offline with `LocalForage`.

   - **Notes Module**:
     - Create a Markdown editor UI.
     - Implement folder-based organization and search functionality.
     - Save notes offline with `LocalForage`.

   - **Calendar Module**:
     - Implement a simple calendar view (daily, weekly, monthly).
     - Allow adding events with reminders.
     - Integrate with Redux for event state management.

   - **Habit Tracker Module**:
     - Create a daily habit check-off UI.
     - Visualize habit progress (daily/weekly streaks).
     - Store habit data offline.

3. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Create a folder structure that separates each module.
   - Establish a plugin loader to handle feature additions dynamically.
   - Set up routes for each feature using React Router.

#### **Deliverables**:
- Basic app structure with core features (To-Do, Notes, Calendar, Habit Tracker).
- Offline data storage for all core modules.
- Modular code structure to support future scalability.

### **Phase 2: Advanced UI Design & Data Persistence (Weeks 4-6)**

#### **Goals**:
- Improve the UI and add customizability.
- Ensure robust offline data persistence and backup features.
- Add a customizable theme system.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **UI Design & Customization**:
   - Implement a dark/light mode toggle.
   - Add UI customization options (color schemes, layout rearrangement).
   - Create reusable React components for buttons, modals, and input fields.

2. **Data Persistence & Backup**:
   - Use SQLite for structured offline data storage, replacing `LocalForage` for modules with complex data.
   - Implement data export (JSON or CSV) for backup.
   - Allow data import to restore or migrate data.

3. **Theme System**:
   - Develop a CSS-based theme engine with custom themes.
   - Allow users to select, create, and save their own themes.
   - Store theme preferences locally.

#### **Deliverables**:
- Enhanced UI with theme customization options.
- Structured data storage with SQLite.
- Data backup and import/export functionality.

### **Phase 3: Plugin System & Integration (Weeks 7-9)**

#### **Goals**:
- Implement a dynamic plugin system.
- Introduce statistics and analytics for productivity tracking.
- Integrate data visualization tools.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **Plugin System Development**:
   - Develop a plugin folder where new features can be added.
   - Create an interface that scans and loads plugins dynamically.
   - Document the plugin structure for easy development.

2. **Statistics & Analytics**:
   - Implement a dashboard to show productivity statistics (task completion, habit streaks).
   - Use `Chart.js` or `D3.js` for data visualization.
   - Add support for weekly and monthly summary reports.

3. **Integration**:
   - Provide a modular interface to sync data with Google Calendar and Trello (optional online feature).
   - Implement notification system for reminders and event alerts using native Electron notifications.

#### **Deliverables**:
- A working plugin system for adding/removing features dynamically.
- Statistics dashboard with visualizations.
- Integration points for external tools and notifications.

### **Phase 4: Testing, Optimization & Release (Weeks 10-12)**

#### **Goals**:
- Test the application for bugs and optimize performance.
- Polish UI/UX for a smoother user experience.
- Package the application for release.

#### **Tasks**:
1. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit tests on React components.
   - Conduct integration testing to ensure plugins and core features work seamlessly.
   - Perform offline tests to ensure all features work without internet.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Optimize Redux state management for performance.
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript bundles for faster loading.
   - Optimize SQLite queries for quick data retrieval.

3. **Packaging & Release**:
   - Use `Electron Packager` or `Electron Builder` to compile the app for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - Create an installer and provide a simple setup guide.
   - Prepare documentation (README) for future development and user instructions.

#### **Deliverables**:
- Fully tested and optimized app with polished UI/UX.
- Cross-platform installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Documentation for users and developers.
